- My friends for testing this out

# Other platforms 
This project is also currently in the process of being made in a google colab notebook(https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1W3BuPFALXNtcWVdC8mtRQjYgWlrIlKUN?usp=sharing), for those that do not know how to install libraries. It is NOT currently functional

# Take Note
1. For any errors/improvements possible, please create an issue and ping me on github. 
2. Run the Hangman_py.py file to run the hangman program
3. No peaking into the DataBase to find the answers. Like come on, its cheating!
5. This program requires the following libraries to be installed (via a package manager or pip or something)
- time
- bs4
- urlopen and urlib.request
- os
- sys
6. Finally, enjoy the game and just don't do anything in general after u download it and ask me why it failed
